# IJC437-Data-Science-Project

This project provides a critical analysis of AI governance within a hypothetical UK National Police (UNP) organisation.
Analyses limitations in current approaches to transparency, public trust, accountability, human oversight, and algorithmic bias in policing AI systems.
The findings show that compliance-focused and technically oriented governance is insufficient to ensure legitimacy, enforceability, and fairness in high-risk law enforcement contexts.
The project concludes by proposing a shift toward auditable transparency, remedial trust mechanisms, enforceable accountability, and anti-bias as a core governance objective.
